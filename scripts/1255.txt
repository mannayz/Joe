all day

yes Alex Jones alive

wow it's good to be back for the second visit it's good to be here man good to see you we've got to Trump meeting with Kim jong-nam and got the culling hearings in Congress one of the energy going on planets are aligned we should tell everybody that you and I had will first will get a long conversation on the phone which led to just a lot of talk to you drop them as if you would and then we decide to do another podcast and we cleared the air on the phone we decide to clear the air more in a podcast there's a lot of things going on I told you a long time ago that I would have you back on and in the interest of being completely honest there's I was hesitant to do it not because I didn't want to talk to you but because of

just the amount of bullshit that I get from people to get angry that you and I are friends you know that why give that guy a platform that's the big ones I give that guy a platform that's the big one and I want it but you and I've always had a good time together was up we've always had fun together are only problems you've always been when we're not like if you're talking about me or if I'm talking about you not if we're talking to each other it's the distance is been the promise to tell if a lack of communication the lack of communication has been the problem the thing that people are upset about you the things we wanted to talk about like quick to get it over with or not quick but just to get it truck up front that's the best yes is the Sandy Hooks guess so

your take on it just give me your take on it

the first off because it's always misrepresented I believe mass shootings happen and they're real tragedies and I believe Parkland happened

and you believe Sandy Hook app absolutely and now just last year the media can onset Alex Jones has Parkland didn't happen and he's sending people to Parkland parents houses and there was no video no audio wasn't true I think I said I believe Parkland happened so I'm not going to be the mass shootings and I'll guy I have been branded as the Sandy Hook timing imagine a Final Cut Pro video editing timeline you go back almost seven years ago I guess more than seven years now and the internet didn't believe some of the things about Sandy Hook covering it weeks after my first things are all this we use for gun control and I bet the guys on Prozac and a mental patient what she was Corbin about my listeners

and other start sending me all these anomalies some things and later turn decimals down with one actor it and then I just moved on from it okay that I didn't kill those kids but what I'm on the streets now people don't know Adam Lanza is the guy that killed those kids take tickets meet they say I can't believe you're not in prison if I don't think that's I think the majority of them are angry because the narrative has been that you're sending people to the Sandy Hook families hulson homes for these people getting harassed because you said on your radio show that it wasn't real yes there is video and audio of me saying I can see how people don't think it happened and I can see how people think it's synthetic is what stage of its before

that didn't get edited put together Cobble together but I never said go to people's houses I never said to investigate you ever say that you think it's not real yes I did but now you do think it's real because I learned some of the anomalies were not accurate that's a problem with all this conspiracy shit right cuz the conspiracy theory stuff the people that want to believe they believe in conspiracies with everything and I think there's a certain percentage we talked about this just a few minutes ago a couple years until I should know I think it happened

then people that I had an interview and thanks for the state he's involved he's one of them because you are now saying that it happened they thought that you'd been compromised this is how people with schizophrenic exactly and then they just think everything's okay this is a thing about conspiracies it's very attractive to people that are schizophrenic schizophrenic people think everything's a fucking conspiracy from top to bottom of every single interaction the people have is some sort of a staged event is trying to take them down or control this or mind control that that's a big factor in a lot of this conspiracy theory shit is mental illness when I started a people come to the office saying that I'm Beau Bridges or that I'm Jeff Bridges or the Bill Hicks and people in restaurant screaming that's you Bill we know it's you it's kind of like Dan Rather the guy threatening that what's the signal down with the signal what I experienced now the quote Fame of being super famous me the conspiracy guy

questioning things because of Gulf of Tonkin Northwoods things are really having babies that weren't trying incubators against the Iraq War but I kind of realize a few years ago that I kind of had my own mild psychosis when you've been lied you to the media and the culture so much over and over again everything then starts becoming automatically you're sure it's fake and everything is she fits into that there's about five years ago I began to realize because I was on the receiving end of people pulling up and white pants with guns at my office Chang I know you put a microchip in my head I'm going to kill you and so it was kind of like once I got super famous it was like whoa

there's a certain percentage of people that are way off on the Spectrum where they believe everything is fake and there's people that believe everything I hear is true I mean you should you should be questioning you should have the right to do it but but it's somewhere in the middle and so this one only questioned it when people brought up anomaly shy then had to Bates about it on both sides the internet push me to keep covering it I'll probably cover 20 x in the first few years it happened and then as soon as I questioned it not being staged I got a text so much that I said screw it mass shootings happen I believe it happened but then media would call me or interview me and say okay but tell us the anomalies why you question they were getting me to say it again

bother them the right to question it but they they thought will Alex Jones vs dead kid Alex Jones and I and I will shelter a sick family this is a perfect way to get this guy who's so popular getting people to question and get people think I think I'm smart not to figure out what's going on so when Hillary few months before the election gets his huge peaches Alex Jones has a dark heart he knows Sandy Hook kids died but he says they didn't and he sends people their houses he's the worst kind of world so I came out and said listen I never see anybody the houses but I apologize was taken out of context you have a right to question but I am sorry for the families of your heart and I get it and I've experienced crazy people now big time just like you have please stop saying that I'm saying it didn't happen please stop saying I'm sending it was outside when they put it on

every major TV channel local TV channels radio has been showing Shane so huge because it supposed to be the first Domino the ones I'm taking down then all the dominoes fall well it's also clickbait there's also a Thing If you say Alex Jones Sandy Hook and you put in a title a certain amount of people just going to click on it Alex Jones is still pushing a Sandy Hook conspiracy theories one that I saw just two days ago exactly

here's the key they didn't I say more people are showing up in in Connecticut more people are coming their houses which they are because the media is all over the news saying there's a big conspiracy here Alex Jones says it doesn't happen and so people can hear it and they think I owe you know it's like looking for the Mothman or something they're all running up there in the media saying and in my name and I'm saying no I believe it happened years ago and so then I'm getting the blame in the attacks on the demonization of the threats for what the corporate media is saying over and over again that I'm saying that it didn't happen and the families are getting the threats and the family is it going to be in tax and the families are getting called crisis actors

oh my God in hindsight is absolutely but I can't I legitimately didn't take my show is as powerful as it was so that I wasn't rent respectively. Looking everything I was doing as much as I should nobody's perfect as you get older you growing you aren't things but I just began to realize about three years ago that they're making my identity not being a nationalist not being a populist not being a free market guy they're making my whole identity Sandy Hook and I know they're going to sue me that was just because that's what gets clicks yes but it's not my daddy I barely ever covered it stop rubbing your scent that's not what they do. Try to make it but they're not trying to make your identity they're not trying to Define you or do some sort of a documentary biography on your life you just finding something that people want to pay attention to this is one of the problems with with news coverage today is that they find things that people want to pay attention to and they focus on

them out of proportionate to say that I'm making money off Sandy Hook when when the newspapers in the publishing houses are using me as a way to put out that it's in your very hurtful thing well I guess also be hurtful I didn't mean to be a I was legitimately and then don't do it and they go know we're going to commit this hurtful thing that's for chill Free Speech but it's hurtful in your freaking name and that message on the victim here I'm saying stop it because everything I do I shall have my huge audience radio stations in your infowars.com and newswars.com but reaching do people's very hard and then now that I've been silenced the mainstream media can say whatever they want show about you about me and I can't respond to you go to YouTube and type in Alex Jones will this is where you and I had this just happened

Alex Jones says kill the families of Parkland parents have to you can pull up the same as Prilosec I forgot all the mean stuff put up on top like the 7th 8th link this is Alex Jones a white supremacy what to do about it and he said it's Alex Jones in a white supremacist are saying go to the people's houses at Parkland and kill the parents and we have taken off the air because just kill the parents there's no free speech for killing parents and I'm like dude do not say that I'm going to get killed I mean I have never said nobody got it parked when I sure as hell it should kill their parents let's let's chill now can we take a step by step making anything you can imagine up about me and and it it's like insane

that's all I'm saying is is that at a certain point it's like Jesus again let's let's take the step-by-step I'm sorry I want to give you an opportunity to communicate and clear the air and talk and some of the shit that you and I talked about earlier there's a bunch of things going on one there's it's a story that attract people's attention

write a story of a guy who sang that people didn't get killed when they did get killed and it's horrific for people to look at its riffic two people to think about that their own children will not only get murdered but then someone would accuse them of being crisis actor so then they start pushing that story and that story becomes something that they make money off of which is really in in some way it's kind of ironic they keep the story in the news and they keep getting clicks off of you and misrepresenting some of the things that you said you wish you hadn't said that's all so real but let's be clear I'm not even defending myself people learn stuff as you get older hindsight your life but why did I do that I used it whatever was the big hot thing on the internet

I would just debated cuz it was interesting over this what I wanted to get to you you were doing the show and in the show you're on the air hours and hours a day and you're ranting about all these various things is it is it fair to say that you weren't really a hundred percent of where what kind of influence you were having and if you did know you would have phrase things differently and done things differently you know they teach even beyond that I was just younger and and I was covering what other people were saying I was not the first 10th the hundredth of 10,000 you're reading about it on the internet stay on all over the news that people are denying it and I've got producers going hey look at this video but it's nothing wrong with every single National tragedy any time something happens there's a certain amount of people that think that there's a conspiracy even when it's just a plane crash even when it's just let it fill in the blanks any sort of national trash like that at all I'm saying

Sandy Hooks not the hell I'm dying on I I support people's right to question and I understand because there's been so much lying and corporate media by governments and and staged events that are admitted Declassified that wants people see that one thing was staged then everything else must be staged and then I have been on the receiving end of thousands of made-up conspiracies what's your laugh at until people in a truck with gun show up I understand

part of this is the complex world we live in all the information we have more than ever and a lot of it is all the drugs people are on Alicia a lot of his skitzofrenix this is a big problem between me and we were talking about the certain percentage of the human beings it affects your judgement this is toxoplasmosis rats brains makes them sexually attracted to spawn trap recites yes is a bunch of them to some of the probably haven't even been identified or the whole crazy cat lady saying come from yes that's exactly what it is it's one of the reasons why they tell women when they're pregnant to stay the fuck away from cat litter don't touch cat litter Dunkin Alesia when are cats yes you can mean it's kicking be actually fatal for babies but I'm sure there's a lot of factors

possessed by that cat and really it's a damn brain worm but it's probably also why they told you not to eat pork

yeah teams have the highest level of brain worm infestation well it's this a disproportionate amount of people that live in countries where the high toxoplasmosis infection was it successful soccer team doing some study that was done on that where we had a Doctor Robert sapolsky women that had motorcycle victims that test positive for toxoplasmosis this is where the Robert sapolsky out of Stanford University was telling us removed to get a brain worm that program to go top of the tree so birds eat it yeah and then and then it scrapped out in the snails eat that and then go and it's a food psych yes yes she don't tell me in classic Evolution and I'm also Within Temptation by five right-wingers in the Bible that's not what it says there's a big quick jumps but we know what's going on but the idea that just there's worms and there's all these different

grasshopper The Aquatic worm gets inside of a grasshoppers body and gets a grasshopper to commit suicide gets a grasshopper to jump into water and drown and then it comes out of its body and that's where it lives it lives in the water so it literally gets its host to commit suicide and it does something a supercomputer couldn't do any programs around itself will this is a matter of complex biology it means I think it's insanely complex and it's something that scientists are studying on a daily basis trying to get me all day

I appreciate you having on her to do it and I and I know I don't have a talking point I don't have a PR firm you leave a top-four went on air about what am I going to do what do you want to say today so you can help me get out I don't know I'm all I want to say a bunch of things I'm only learning how this works being in the process of it and it's going to be a much bigger of you that I do 23 years ago when I first got on here because I've experienced what other people have said these bad things I did experience I did it from a good heart I believe question was okay I was covering other people questioning but then there's a weird sick irony in the media says that

I'm the one that put generated Sandy Hook didn't happen when I wasn't true that in my name popularize it to a level of like they put out more shallow breathing problems before you change your country has been going on for years every day the news the friend no one died at Sandy Hook Alex Jones says it goes on and on and on and would you were thinking this because it's about you so because it's about you it becomes a primary point of focus because it's affecting your life and something you're concentrating on massive because it's something that generates interest this is part of the problem with the way we do news today anything that generates interest I mean if they honestly if the media really care they probably would have never talked about it

they probably never brought it up that we had a real terror attacks in the sixties and seventies that weren't staged to go back and look at them like the weatherman all that stuff in it and the government immediate didn't cover it months is a long time if you cover terrorist I do it more that's true of mass Shooters in the newspaper cuz they don't want people to get attention for that mean something different countries at the hospital and I realized it once I saw a bunch of be classified staged event like North Woods or like gladio or Lionel the Tonkin Gulf of Tonkin or or jussie Smollett probably show me the day after it happened I said the guy's got a noose around his neck at 2 a.m. in in Chicago and a noose in Chicago who's walking around with a news who even knows how to write who knows how to

make a news like who's in the cop show up

40-something minutes later he's at the door with a noose around its neck in the Subway sandwich because if you if you're a little kid is having read more about psychology try to understand the stuff if you're a little kid and somebody was red hair beat you and tortured man with red hair so it's kind of like or as a kid has been on this light right and she all these fake hoaxes and you're the face of about Kavanaugh on the pics of other Covington kid and in the face of a small it she that's now the public actually a huge backlash and smell it

it's not it's not a man who's giving you back last book in the public are like hey the Covington kids are fake blasey Ford and most women said it was all fake so why are you saying Sandy Hook's real everything's fake it's like no dude everything's not fake that's what I'm saying is the differentials gone and there's a bunch of fake stuff and we had a right to question but now now now the general public my fans believe everything she said it but let me stop you there I'm ranting I just it's okay I want you to rent this but this is this is the nature of the Beast this is what you're selling to a lot of these people this is why they're tuning into you they want to hear you uncovered conspiracies and some of them aren't as bright as others and some of them can't see logic they don't see they don't understand why I don't just think I know you don't listen I think of you never talked about Sandy Hook you to have no problems I really do believe that I believe they would be problems I've been

people would look down on you and call you a right-wing lunatic and all sorts of other things which they don't even know when I knew you when I first knew you you were getting arrested for going after George Bush I member when George you are not a right-wing talking about you hear what you were asking him a pertinent question of the CFR in his dad's drugged yes exactly exactly and this is the guy that was running for president as a Republican and you you were getting arrested for? Contra the CFR point is you weren't you weren't a tie to a party you were trying to find the truth and I always pray hands when I align with Trump that's when all hell broke loose yeah yeah that was part of it I think that was definitely match she looked at my whole bio and said Sandy Hook hit him on that right now you still communicate with Trump

not in a while and I wish I could come as a big issue and I obviously communicate with surrogate should be able to talk to Trump I mean. Junior was on Tucker Carlson last night were talking about me and saying what happened is wrong and use me as a way to start the cactus society and then and then and then I imagine you're never supposed to block somebody from banking if they have a good record here's a little story I had an a-plus-plus rating with my shopping cart and bank accounts that I had for 22 years and Banks looking into said we've quite frankly never seen anybody with a credit rating this High because you never even to charge batch with our shopping cart people do that was I mean chargebacks

AA group out of Boston which I'm not going to mention if you're showing things that we're preparing litigation against who does the ratings to secret rating system for like Taliban Al-Qaeda the Mafia That's the tea of the bank Executives 2 days before PayPal Bandits they put a hate designation of a Southern Poverty Law Center Shane I'm basically a terrorist so when they call you a hate person now that means that are person Interpol show all over the Western world

I am listed and we would send documents out of England and I would have you asked that we were sent to spy my little thing people are freaked out we make contact lawyer texted I can't believe it they have designated me as an international terrorist and that's how they took five of my sick bank account and got me down to one bank account with perfect credit Shang you cannot take money on your shopping cart and foursquare.com your product t-shirt books whatever you you are a lot of Ben Converse because you are a terrorist and what do they use to Define terrorist it's classified symbol so we got some of the document just hate I just hate and then just let me just decide arbitrarily that you're a hateful person that you promote hate no judge no jury at the global Chinese social score that's what they're all testing for here this is what we're talking about this very important this is actually dangerous this is actually dangerous to give people the bility to Define people without any strick rigid qualifications without anything you can point to on paper

I got out of prison cert online store and sell t-shirts but if I was Charlie Manson specials on on on CBS on 60 Minutes and I don't think you saw to get paid for those though I think that was part of the thing cuz of he's involved in more so you can hear what Hitler has to say even though we know he's a bad guy well why can't you read Alex Jones has to say because they have found what I talked about as effective against people thinking and they want it shut down because we we were launched populism Imports has done this but I can test 1776 worldwide

populism anti globalism anti-communism anti-china in the big tech companies Google and apple and all of them have publicly move to China and they publicly agreed to censor I control the populations in the nose and that's why she got so mad at me and I made a huge issue to Trump and I sent reports the present I know he got and that's what happened on that Sunday night when they said that's it we're done Papa John's we have to take him down because I got investigations going at the National Security level sending big reports the president through law firms of Reuters and AP and then the Articles which he wasn't getting where China is given of the code keys by Applebee's last year and is moving their database they're all the cookies have been given to the Chinese government and a Bible says I just part of being there and Google's building dragonfly project help since the entire population with a social credit score China they're going to bring it here and everything you do in life will be controlled and

air lines down that are putting cameras in that watch you while you're on the airplane. Sandy Hook as an excuse to get you off the air and a sensor you going to take away your ability to make income not because of that but using that as an excuse because of the other things you do like targeting things like Google and talking about things that you talking about where it was there in China in China is allowed they're allowing time to censor the population don't go help China do this stuff don't be evil but I only tell you something cuz I knew I knew someone who worked at Google I know someone who used to work at Google I should say their thought process was that Google is going if they don't bring Google to China in the center form they're going to copy Google this is the real the real worried because China copies everything I mean there is intellectual copyright law over there

better now true but if this is what they're saying about that job explain something from the point of view of Google as a business and I don't necessarily not saying I agree with this cuz I don't get some apple juice in your system fella they were thinking this is what I was talking to a woman who was a very high-level executive and she was saying that they're going to steal it if we don't work with them they're just going to steal Google and and take the code and make their own version of it so them as a business or like this is inevitable they're going to do it anyway we're just going to give in to their censorship damn it I don't agree with it I don't think it's a good idea but I don't know what I would do if I was Google I'll tell him

you'll tell what I'll tell you what should I do for China you're dead on what that person told you when I had the globalist 15 years ago 20 years ago try to buy me often the year you know whatever by the way cheers when they did all that

what I did all that what were they trying to do who's turn the volume up where I can't get into your private meetings and it's it's journalist on the inside if you don't join this help save the planet and do all these big things my dad got the same speech when he was in high school rtut it planned to tell you about that later but if you don't join us then the bad guys are in the system are going to win that's how they kill off because that's how those people you're talking about a pretty good person that person to Google they've had hundreds of their top Engineers quit over this because you're not here

China in 1949 was Nationalist and and capitalists in our own CIA Declassified left us the Ford Foundation that's what's about the CIA helped put the chai comes in power it took him decades to get running water in toilets they have no environmental standards no rules that had all of our investment they've been built up because the Chinese, she'll do whatever the globalist want when you go and you are in China they make you become skate run to get 0% tax corporate 0% corporate tax look it up now and you become state-sponsored state-run show they're claiming

show the China doesn't rapist of our technology we're going to go over there and spread our legs to him even more so it's not a rape we're willing and we're going to take you along with us so the idea that well if we don't give it to him they're just going to rip it off so let us go really give him all the big secrets and and have Google ask your till the Pentagon we're not going to help you with a Thomas drones but Google gave them all the way to a i

and I'll get them or so she gets up in the moment gave them all the sophisticated Ai and now China announces they've got all these AI drones are autonomous and all these AI weapon systems the director aircraft show telling you is China has no rules 20 years ago they had cows that produce human milk 20 years ago they had spiders that British body armor spider does okay they have human-animal hybrids 30 years ago they've got giant human tissue Farms you know you hear all your your Achilles is torn we've got a grown a lab attendance not a freaking 10 and growing a lab it's a freaking that deal humanoid these are humans the way to get around it is a measurement win-win-win listen I love you to death but you say so many dollars comes to real I believe they are but you say so many different things without stopping its hardest people to absorb

play Jojo quarterly 25 years ago that they had human animal embryos but they killed him in the embryonic level I believe I believe that. Humanoid I believe this I've been able to use crispr to enhance children it was done HIV if something about HIV immune to HIV no yes

bubbles want to play God I hope they call a breakaway civilization

what's up with somebody bring me to a sexual assault. Sandy Hook which I get I appreciate you let me cover and I'm sorry I never have and I believe that happened I'm sorry for people's pain and then I asked the families and I asked to do the lawyers and ask them all shopping my name sing on the wolf at the door Shane go after these families and stop running around to the news everywhere saying Alex Jones says Sandy Hook didn't happen because the media State media is the most unpopular the world was 7% approval rating in Gallup so when they say that I say it's fake that sends people to Connecticut because people think the media lies so they're saying it must have happened and now they're trying to create a violent event. The family but I think some of the people involved know that if they make a big enough hype about it they're going to have a big event up there in Connecticut you understand they're going to blame it on me no no no I believe it happened stop saying I said it didn't happen and stop saying that I'm saying no kids died cuz I want to talk about human-animal hybrids and humanoid

it's a joke why is it bad to be a humanoid why because if you make it a few percentage points another animal or another creature it's a gray area there is no human rights you have an animal rights movement you have a human rights movement there is no alien movement they're creating human-animal hybrids that are a new creature never here on Earth it's alien show the aliens are already here AI is alien the chimeras are Alien aliens are already here so you're saying they're making these human-animal hybrid so they can what Harvest tissue from them

that's just level one with level 2 what's up late because a lot. I'll tell you a lot for the best of my knowledge a lot of people think oh it's it's it's human harvesting a falun Gong are these boots really healthy that's big that's going on because they still have a better non rejection right but with the chimeras I remember 22 years ago reading a BBC article that was kind of testing the waters that case when we tested and then go oh yeah about 15 years ago the first animal human Chimera for Maiden test if they're not brought to term but sometimes when I'm playing some in your house because I'm such a bigger Universe you rub a bigger humanoid and get more tissue and so then I went by there go research that so I went to UT library that time could use some of the internet like 1996 and I actually pulled up all these MIT report took them to my dad other people who is dr. Yeah that's really crazy and it was all about how

we got to prepare the public for this because we're going to be able to download their memories and then put it in a new body this is before Blade Runner Associates jog this is the world's not imitating Blade Runner Blade Runner is a preparation for what's coming and they're telling you more human than human this is going to be more advanced this is going to be better but like everything like a cell phone for like a vaccine it's got a trojan horse it's got a backdoor it's already been tested it's already been perfected it's being rolled out you're not giving a real technology you're not giving the real life extension you're giving the crap Joe and the Earth is seen is like an egg yolk to give the propulsion power in this new thing that's going to be born and whether you believe that or not just like when the new thing me artificial intelligence beyond that it's an option of artificial intelligence and a whole shift assistant new life-forms

and so that's the big giant race when he want to watch Game of the told you that she goes he's doing her functions he has a concert so he's freaked out and then go these delete or functions I don't just know this I've talked to people and I was in Wired Magazine 20 something years ago why the future doesn't even smell Joy a billionaire co-owner Sun Microsystems he goes to a billionaire meeting with 200 guys and the consensus was play video games and party all day we're going to set up a world government or in a slowly titrate the dos and poison the public. Mime down put electromagnetic radiation out with 5G the scrambles rdna lowers your IQ we're in a car smash mental illness and a controlled societal collapse that will then be organized and control in the mop-up crew by robots controlled by the globalist programmers who believed with the offworld and if he's there in communication with that they're going to be given the operation to upload and be in that larger kind of Borg Cube system okay hit they said they sell the country you got to hit the brakes I'm so baffled what's the matter

MIT MIT technology review estimated about 20 pregnancies of pig human or sheep human chimeras have been established during the last 12 months in the US 500% believe it look I think that especially the 1985 I'm sure I believe I believe I believe that they will take all sorts of Liberty's in Gray areas when it comes to scientific research I definitely believe there's a lot of different things moms trying to ignite the atmosphere operation starfish Prime day actually texted a nuclear bomb the doctor did not detonate a nuclear bomb in the upper arm

everything I know about all this and you got mad at me so we can communicate

are you sure it's not going to call him now it's not that I can't handle it it's there's two factors one I don't have an anytime I don't have enough time to go into it as much as you do a fucking subject you know all about it I don't know all about this bullshit you know exactly what you're going to think you're a bad guy you're trying to survive you and your family and do good okay but just don't make the Breakaway civilization the deal's been made it's not it's not the third dimension they made freaking deals with inter-dimensional aliens and noticed this is true I do not know this and this is still okay I do not know this human pig hybrid Jamie just pull this out I believe it's true

my identity it's not that I get it they admit 5G all the studies LA Times causes massive mutation and cancer wait a minute away with this is the new Internet Protocol change tell you you're on fire, okay you know about pigs and rats were most closely related to a bunch of pansies that's why I like the organs of the rejected you know about that yes or very close to human pig organs in people with steps

it's true but you don't know everything I know that's what no no I don't listen when I tell you that

oh yeah we had human-animal hybrid this is like freaking 39 years ago now 23 years ago I'm really in the BBC about it and go confirm attack okay and they're just floating there was an article in 1999 in the Baltimore Sun Country baggage who is his dad was a US senator he's he like he should have known these are the guys that got all the money Americans you spell his last name is good friend of mine can I get the point is so what does he do he was telling me all these years ago he goes Alex isn't chemicals in the food water that's Channel SMU its electrochemical

but I'm reading in the Baltimore Sun after I just had him on until he was crazy as give me all these patents for mind control using Wave links in microwave and I'm sitting there looking at it and I'm reading it and I'm pushing it and the Baltimore Sun says the CIA is testing on cell towers wave links to calm the public during crises I just had baggage on with patents talking about that what that is it's not that the microwave I've somehow interface with the brain we already interface with a space wins all these other magnetic fields everything else so they're all just testing this stuff into everything they deployed it got all these other Technologies my dad was Beauty and 65 when was in high school starting at CD-ROMs computers everything but it's absolutely that's what I'm telling you it's a breakaway civilization dude we don't know what they got we don't know we don't know who we don't know the whole thing that's what I'm telling you is this is hiding in plain view and that's why it's so crazy imagine if you knew all

you're trying to tell people and they go oh God he's doing that find one thing he did a chance me and make that his whole world that's what I'm telling you is it in the newspaper that the cell towers are being used for mind control that sounds like a schizophrenic use a cell towers from falling around town and thinks their dog is watching them and we're actually aliens you've got someone over here someone over here to believe everything they see on Fox News yes okay what street is good science is good trying to figure out what's real and all of us get freaked out but make sure the world no one knows what the universe is we don't have all the answers that question especially low IQ shows they have to differentiate and create a model that allows them to put it in boxes so they can make it make sense because they can't handle it

top astronaut spacewalk for the first time and they're out in the universe and the whole planets under them and what are they going to do they can eat it it's mind-blowing will imagine once you realize we don't know everything we don't understand English and there's all this crazy crap people donut and as humans learn more more as we become more advanced it was this metamorphosis it's going to create a giant suicidal crisis or most of people already going to get killed the globalist understand that in the birth of this planet dismiss PCS and so they decided to take control make a scientific stun everyone in downtown so they can scientifically try to order leak air this operation I'm going to go wait a minute you're detonating over a hundred hotter than bombs the upper atmosphere to see if you could ignite the atmosphere destroy the Earth was in his sixties I know but what I'm telling you is the same professors train people's crap at those people are dead the people that detonated those hydrogen bombs in the 60s they're dead Now does not we're not dealing with the same human beings I'm with you on most

I agree with you in some ways that everything evolves and things get better this is one of my argument about operation Northwoods that if they were able to push operation Northwoods to get it signed by The Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962 was it 62 table to do that and no one went to jail and no one got arrested for proposing that they were going to arm Cuban Friendly's and have them bomb Guantanamo Bay and blow up a Cuban jetliner and shoot people to be there right yes yes that seems evolve things evolve and if unchecked and obviously that was unchecked no one went to jail for that and we got in trouble for that PBS covered it like I never even knew this let's read this one here the significance of the research explain is that although the cell phone power is low electromagnetic radiation can nevertheless have an effect on mental behavior when transmitting at the proper frequency what is this article Jamie side of America in Scientific American it's titled mind control by cell phone so it really does have an effect added a whole study on

no further it doesn't so there is so would you think that they're making this cop that she qualified last year they were putting up shell towers that look like trees already testing at neighborhoods okay did you know that that that is one way but beyond that it's a microwave relay relay system they can manipulate and then the powers even more powerful so this is a device given by the gods okay given us by the technology that that the Breakaway government NASA has developed that you don't just think they made up themselves what do you mean who do you think made it up but when you're ready to get to it I want to listen to understand something about how to spot us to join the meat is not

the meat of the real research that I have heard that that I have talked to Army generals commanding generals major generals General General CIA everybody and they're all 100% And I thought it was a sign up before and then I'm researching I talked to hundreds of people that are not on there but I'mma make a film on this who taking Ayahuasca and DMT I'm not taking it and obvious reasons and

and it's unbelievable because I needed a hundred percent in San Francisco is the main project site literally have an alien base and they are literally communicating I did not like astronaut level people taking super hardcore levels of drugs and going into meetings with these things and making Intergalactic deals this is a magician you say the government it's a broad stroke you painting using a broad brush and what you mean by the government Rogue Intelligence Agency of drugs to communicate with inter-dimensional beings all right everyone who's done a high dose of psychedelic drugs has had this experience so everyone is listening to you right now who's done DMT or done 5 grams of psilocybin they know that this is a you have some kind of communication with something else the question is

is that something else inside your psyche or is that something else a chemical heart or Shay is there a chemical doorway Inside the Mind that opens up in the belief is that when you die and this is what the afterlife is that when you die your brain produces these chemicals these chemicals open up this doorway and this is the portal to the next Dimension so you're saying you're saying that the government is aware this name must be aware of this it hurt enough people talk about it they must have done experiments on it really hoping things and people that have the courage to experiment with these things and try them themselves realize that this is such a profound experience that it is it's so alien that if an alien landed right now in our parking lot and a little gray man with big black eyes got it would be nothing compared to what I've seen on psychedelic trips

maybe getting into this show is just because some people need to understand that I know about this for a long time and I just don't think people are ready for it but a lot of folks

low oxygen and and heavy and I hope reins well well who have your sleep apnea of a Big Macs big heads to like you and me have a 62% oxygen that's another time that the brain releases DMT show my whole life since I was about my first memories were every night was a DMT trip so I basically

I don't want this to sound arrogant it's not I've seen everything well I believe that when you're dreaming it's most likely the same chemicals that are being released opens the gate which side is it proven your brain is working the 4th 5th 6th Dimension and if you don't work into those images you can see beyond it so it's what I'm trying to tell you is this here's what's happening

I'm not saying you're bad I never said you were the CIA I say the CIA is on record with Timothy Leary and everybody promoting hallucinogens in the sixties they admitted it was a plan to try to see what it would do in public to make the more suggestible

but there's a larger program and then I kind of backed off because it kind of got out of control and actually created some some some people are actually fighting so so it didn't have the effect they want it so the name moved on the Ayahuasca and the DMT they promoted which good strong people have got Compass don't have problems with the weak-minded stupid people and others Pierce example this guy smart Erich Mancow Muller show Generator house I don't like him just to just lost me walking around everybody's everybody's on this Quest

I told you a hundred people affected more as long as we're going to do in these these DMT and Ayahuasca trips outside Austin to get them all over the place yes and

I want to show you some of the same story everybody tells you live in Peru or being young Costa Rica when did two trips down there

and he said yeah we're sitting there and we take the I lost it and then all these basically elves aliens come out of the woods and we're all saying the same aliens we're all hearing the same thing and it's like 43 of us or whatever she and he goes but it was the drugs affecting our brains no no a drug everyone see something different when you open a gate and now inter-dimensionally your brains already filtering out most stuff because you can't handle your eyes are already seeing like a cat looks like seeing something in her dog will you know when they first identified there certain certain components to Ayahuasca and one of them is harming and when they first identified it they tried to call it telepathy mean that's a reason why they call it telepathy and because when they were taking Ayahuasca do Havanese group experiences that were undeniable they were experiencing like very vividly the same things and

prompt that that term the government he talked about the post office is a shity turn however they are okay but that that term the problem with that term is it lumps you in as I know that Mel Gibson movie Conspiracy Theory was wackadoodles driving a cab and believed in fucking tinfoil Hat type yes exactly compartmentalize yes but but that kind of stuff when you say the government is doing it like who is doing this who's working on these experience

we don't have the same name spelled with a broad brush and the big question is who they when everybody says they don't want you to know I remember that fucking guy who is ripping people off like weight loss secrets that they don't want you to know Kevin Kevin Trudeau they put him in jail for that he's in jail right now he won't give up the money cuz you got a pile of cash somewhere and he said he would do that they would I think they said they would give him a right to say Healthcare cures the computers I don't know about there are some other point is they don't look I have some love in my heart for Kevin Trudeau because he started International pool tour was he's putting a lot of money in the professional pool Oxycontin company the documents came out that we're going to totally a dick people and then we're going to sell him drugs to get off of it.

I know about him and it was like he was 100% about him and 1wayfrank straight well I didn't get that experience with them with me and I him just talked about pool I was doing some stuff with him when he was first starting the pool to where I came to a couple of his events but he that they this thing there is like you always have a good way of asking questions instead of saying who runs it all right you wait till I do the cliche and you correct me what I'm doing is Playing devil's advocate and I'm also looking at it from the perspective not yet you want me to come at 2 instead of 1. I'm having a good time with you I just want you to know that I can't say all of this on there okay okay and I'm going to leave it at that but I'm on record 20 years ago before anybody else was talking about The Clockwork elves and now the glove was think they're in touch with his empty some things only

I don't want to get I'm not the CIA the CIA is bigger than Coca-Cola Chan basic there than Walmart I never been in intelligence agency I've ever been a part of any other stuff

but I have family that was in advanced DARPA research projects that I don't know all the details about and I was a kid my dad told me about some of it not talk show host Larry the light when the deputy director the CIA show Carol I can't tell you all about it but it's a classified program in Maryland and underground base and they won't give me all the channels what's double the money I'm making now this is for National Security but I think I think it's basically yeah we're going to we're building cyborgs and we've got Special Forces of the volunteer we can infiltrate the Russians and get to codes and systems and I believe it's implanting but messages in their teeth and I didn't and I also think as I do implants I think it's a brain surgery program for micro chest and and so I'm here and I'm sick of these people and you've already done so much for the apartment and look what they've already done to you and I'm at my my

whether you're not going to be in you know that I want you out of this so this is like you know seven eight years old and I learned about the about the cyborgs okay okay show show that's the kind of stuff that tiger of shape and you know all let's go get your uncle he's come out and see 130 you know Army thing army uniform from Guatemala machine guns I mean I don't know okay and I need to know okay the point is just that's what I grew up know the type of stuff I shot

add

my dad never told me about all this stuff when I was older till it was like 12 years ago and I was finishing in game blueprint for Global enslavement it's free still online and it's all about the world government and how their cell phones watching you and everything you didn't come for it was already truth and the plan for one world government and don't have kids and all that attack on the family and we were going to ballet recital for like my three-year-old daughter she's 14 hour and they should have like an hour and watch the end of the film 3 Hour film and my mom goes Cape attached not true

Hells yes it's all true when I was in junior and I still have recruited me another program there and they brought us and I said the Nazis were wrong because they're only charge a certain groups everybody in the planetary break away and World governments blah blah blah does a nuclear reactor under UT and also stops but the point is that special my dad was like for like the sixth smartest in Texas and I got a group of less than 10 kids and they brought them in as juniors in high school and said we're going to do all this cuz I want to be an ass as soon as he gets in here because Daddy has a big secret group it's the other side of the break by government there's the CIA break like I'm at 1947 and there's Kennedy setting up NASA 1961 solar two different competing Breakaway governments and those are the real garbage in the USA by Breakaway governments what do you mean Breakaway governments Breakaway civilizations it's the real groups that are like the cult

who are they are scientist called who were based on your psychic ability and on your IQ and then on your commitment to the program answer the program starts with will you go and check black people Shuffle us for a greater cause or will you do research programs on babies where we tell poor women that your baby died while they were born Rodeo keep the baby alive and sometimes kill him sometimes Harvest some experiments on that's why I don't know your baby. That's why the governor said it was actually warm and Hardesty Dr he knows we keep the babies and love every little blonde and have a discussion they are getting caught now cuz we be compartmentalize what I'm confused what you're saying what are you saying about babies like what are they doing with babies you you saw the governor of Virginia Shea we keep baby's light after their born chilling right

I didn't see that I am very very concerned with late-term abortions get weed in 7 and 1/2 pound baby they keep alive for two weeks then Mama doesn't know so they can register the organs and get bitters play me your nation makes 500000 what are you saying that the baby they kill on the spot only get 50 Grand in there that they take the baby from the mother in the mother doesn't know the baby's alive yeah you know how they are tomatoes the last on the Shelf yes

you can pull all this up California's past it. Should be Virginia Virginia is about to pass a New York trying to pass a California trying to pass it to other states trying to pass it to keep babies alive and allow noticed the governor goes we don't want we don't want the government involved the doctors and the mothers drugged up and say that I'm going to decide about the future and maybe she keep Baby Alive a week maybe she's trying to get rid of baby wait a minute is this a viable baby there's nothing wrong with this baby on Monday

to not pass a bill for post-birth abortion should not kill him a little post birds as a viable babies already born can be killed if the by weather for I bet you ten millions pull that up Jamie we got to figure out what do you say Snopes Huffington Post is that Snopes at the mostly false go to YouTube and type in

governor of Virginia talks about post-birth abortion I see the left so compartment on the singer the left mainstream media whenever we're so censored now they're making their move right now who's today want to learn the secrets of University Leone singing so what you're saying is a lot of the censorship a lot of this is about. Hahaha I'm not kidding I will give $1000000 to your charity of choice

I've got to listen to me I will give you 1 million dollars if you can prove that I'm making up at the governor said we keep babies alive after they're born we keep them comfortable and then turns out he's an organ harvesting thing and that's what they're doing so they keep babies alive don't go to snow don't you the governor go to the governor of Virginia

that's why they went ahead and Bernie for the black face they're using the blackmailing they are as soon as he should be there as soon as Trump and we all covered as soon as he tweeted he said yes we're getting rid of babies after they're already born you don't want to do that no I already figured out with George Soros putting it right

no I'm going to oversimplify that to me get to find out if I know what time does tuna loose anagen category so it causes more schizophrenia I think he does I said that she was going to court. I think it does I think it does look certain people I've simplified tax return yeah that was funny the only time I feel weird fucking George Bush and George Bush senior master dance around the capitol spawn times does the song that you wrote a song about it Jamie Jamie this is a joke I will give $1000000 you don't have to give any money but I believe you I just want to live and I have skin in the game I believe you I mean he's going to find it

you don't have to wear listening to you and then he uses these arguments he uses his argument he does well sometimes baby sometimes the baby is is the phone no they want the organs and so who should baby week with partial birth they keep the baby alive they take it in the back and then they have a fan pull up that takes it to a Chinese government run facility in the US and they got to suck this listen to this day video on third trimester abortions as well as other restrictions now in place and she was pressed by Republican delegate about whether her bill would permit an abortion even is a woman is sexually dilating ready to give birth

and she answered that it would prevent an abortion at that stage of Labor do you support her measure and it explained her answer call Julie and I certainly can't speak for delegate Tran but I will tell you one first thing I would say this is why decisions such as this should be made by providers are Physicians and are the mothers and fathers that are involved involved there are you know it when we talked about third trimester abortions these are done with the consent to Abba see that the mother with the consent of the Physicians more than one position by the way and it's done in cases where there may be severe to form

is there may be a defeatist that's 9 Bible so in this particular example if a mother is in labor I can tell you exactly what would happen if the infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable infant would be resuscitated if if that's what the mother in the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the Physicians and the mother so I think this was really blown out of proportion but again we want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions we want the decision to be made by the the mothers and their providers in and this is why Julie that legislators most of whom are men by the way shouldn't be telling a woman what she should and shouldn't be doing with her body as is currently required she's trying to live that requirement well I think it's always good to get a second opinion and 4/4 at least two providers to be involved in that decision because these decisions shouldn't be taking

lightly and so that you know I would I would certainly support more than one provider that's a weird thing that you just kind of let him say weird is that she was told they were talking about resuscitating the baby that they would keep the baby alive than the decision will be made isn't that that's like euthanasia like you kidding me right you're Grammys like 80 years old you can't you can't just kill her. They said that's one explain now you've got it did you hear that legal H turns out when I saw that clip a month ago cuz they had a debate about the bill and I will kill babies after they're born and how far I'll go

but it's jurisprudence there's law you can't do that so this is taking over the government not involve this is the medical system you sharpen if they can kill a baby after it's born cuz sometimes a deformed sometimes it the phone here's the key

notice he said we were suscitate they don't consider you alive till the bioethics board shares that you're a vile human and under the bioethics in Europe and are the UN now which is all knots above the EU was set up by the Nazis Volkswagen I might as well so I can sell that that that was literally drawn the first was taken by Hitler Dowdy the Olympic symbol and Hitler was a really bad dude but he literally everything

they had a system where they first killed babies they thought were deformed that was 1934

and the final solution having like six seven years later and so he sang cuz I got a big problem I got Undercover videos are keeping babies alive want to pull those up I might be asking for doesn't so they've got to start getting it going now with Governor Physicians and people to go to the nurses are freaking out and they're saying we're keeping babies alive when they can put the van and drive away what's going on are you comfortable show the babies worth $500,000 who's in the chain of delivery just on time delivery organs worth a lot of money and go but but if you kill him right on the spot they're like why are we wasting this 7 lb of meat so she if they can keep them alive and how they built these new Wings they don't do ants have wings where they go oh we consider the baby dead the mother decided it didn't live if she decides we were suscitate the lives but it gif

resuscitate its flesh it's illegal aliens it's passed into a special Ward with doctors and make a few million a year and a little lash ball is kept alive and comfortable until all the orders come in the planes land and they take the organs and they take the the the blood and they take the skin Joe you see how it work now you know why my dad do organ Harvesters in Dallas and he said don't sign your organ donor card they've got corrupt hospitals where if you get her totally viable they take your organs of cheese and then and then my dad to the hospital to Adele's then when I was Jack a decade later at my grandparents house where Grandpa died watching 60 minutes

people that were viable to take her organs tonight they 60 Minutes Expose and it was a freaking hospital my dad told me about you at the kitchen table when you're right here in about cyborgs T. Why I know about this my dad never got fully into it he decided to get out of it

exercise to get out of it he was legitimately freaking me the fuck out Joe I will I will let you know the problem is some of it makes sense because people figure out a way to rationalize a lot of things if you see a guy's mangle the car accidents but he still alive and you know you could sell the Arkansas I mean the book but the thing is how many people would have to be involved for that to be real show you

songs that you write 15 videos of Planned Parenthood workers laughing saying I made a million bucks yesterday last year it's incredible when you just keep him alive longer will get 10 times the money when I get to 50 grand for baby cuz we got to kill them before they leave the building the mother. No there. They talked her into it home and all the baby might have a problem I have a heart murmur oh yeah and then they get the your finger to get to this is true but only a few hours and they got to get planes coming in and vans and they don't get the full price cuz they can't put on the auction page. Digital corporate auctions look us up for Oregon's bring something up to you I had this guy on yesterday El narcos name is you on Grillo and he's he's an investigative journalist to visit Mexico and he studies the cartel organs and put this one of the things he was saying was that they they get these people used to killing and they were getting these kids

how many kids killed at a young age and dismembered people and they were doing it to get the fear of the body so this one guy who was that they had a nickname for him Tyson he would he was a cop but he was also in charge of hiring these little kids and training these little kids to be assassins and he would teach them how to dismember people and who's going into it and all the things they didn't all the bad things that they did it was saying that they try to get the in certain certain groups of people when they have this organization they try to get them used to horrific acts of blood and that's a short-term healthiest Ash is that the SS is your Hitler had about seven eight years for lunch the war so he got like 12 year olds Ready for War and they would get them like having fun swimming working out at boxing and then they would like more like 15 going to super hot hooker and they give them drugs LSU to get discovered switch to Hitler was put them on DMT everything

they would then have these religious experiences and that you're Invincible your Superman this is Albany classify butts and more esoteric riding

and so they would get them all wound up and then to graduate as an SS officer after you'd had a dog like 5 years you had to strangle your German Shepherd yeah that was my friend re his dad was in the Israeli Special Forces or one of those 1 Brantwood you know what branch was one branch of the Israeli military and they had to kill a kitten get a raise kitten and killing Jews are just like anybody else there cuz I got so screwed by the Nazis and want to stick anyway just kind of copy a lot of it and by the way I'm not even my point is just that the Nazis got evil down so much like we brought 34,000 in the Run NASA there on the University's Operation Paperclip buddy wanted Nazis they were like they were going on in the lottery because they were all happened was first I gave him a power that they would really pressroom had to go through things

and then they would basically you're just condition them to do whatever they were told they call the cement of blood because then she likes to kill your dog when I'm there when I was going to Rockwall Texas I really like a 6-unit call avocados grow as a senior in high school superhot I'm in I'm in I'm in the I'm in 9th grade and like she's picking me up in a Mercedes and I take me some Mansion the secular is incredible and I'm walking out of the house cuz I was like I was about sixteen when I was 13 R2 shows you join us we love Lucifer you get all that you want boy we want you but but really oh yeah but that's about all this but the point is is that

turn the Satanist. I really got to say this and I said what I said what what do you want cuz I don't want to lose you kill your dog the point is is that now all these years later kill a loving thing that serves cares about you this interface dogs are very psychic or psychic by her dogs are able to interface with you and they want you to take something that's where you to die for you and they want you to kill that that's like killing child a dog is very spiritual very holy and very good at. We'll take on its Masters or a and evil but job is to know about all this and this is what's going on this is what's happening and show so they want to submit a blood is that get people in a group and they get a new horrible evil things during per pressure and then they create the synthesis get to know the darker elements of the criminal networks there inside our government are actually running Mexico as a Laboratory test

I'm part native American model x 6% Comanche and you know Texas and just that little bit makes me wild so they can get them cuz they're powerful their smart meter cool but genetically that go into groupthink really really fast and so Native Americans you can mind control really fast

well it's like Vietnam me you know the depth of the Bering land straight and they say Tessa genetics of mesoamerica spacely Chinese or whites and Vikings won the area but like they don't like the fact that they're conscious control people but when they get into a fight they all stink up in a robot that no fear we know about psychotic killers are fighting and so Asians are about the most Fearless killers that are the Mongols with the history of the Mongols conquer this from their Heritage of war that there's a long look like if you think about Japan Japan has a long history of being a noble Warrior culture with a Samurai's and flight status for the marshalship something there

it's the genetics revolutionary so much martial arts came from Kendo sword fighting karate above a bunch of different branches of karate Judo Jiu-Jitsu Japan all that stuff came from Japan I mean that that that is a group of people that were obsessed with combat mean they they figured out a ruling class was well not just that the soldiers and even the civilian the ruling class was the Shogun and when you think about what a small place Japan is and how stunning it is that's so much Innovation especially in terms of like what am I to work martial arts black people that are smart as any white person and then you got like a little way better at sports Whenever there are genetic differences when I spit in the you got the head of your former It's Cold Springs Harbor watching him down to the blacks aren't human all that BS

Rochester racist crap to the government but it's true that Northern some groups are Northern Europeans and then the Japanese on average per capita of the ice and so are there Japanese and then there are some Northern Europeans that had the highest IQs but then you can get in the lights a juice have very high IQs whenever it gets a bunch of others not just one type of intelligence for sure yeah well there's there's there's test that you can run in terms of mathematics but there's no real test you can run terms of social connectivity they proved that DNA is a transceiver and show my skill is that's why I'm usually coming almost artistic is I'm just being like everything's going on what's it about you focus on I can like figure out the exact enemy operation that's why they're really pissed

gay people that are Jewish that are German there Chinese or Japanese or Italian or Mexican people that either through fear or whatever get into Dark Side Light Side get into don't give people the knowledge control the people down them down dominate them because they're only rocket fuel for you to go to the next level you know what's interesting about this not that you're right or wrong what's interesting is how many people resist the idea that it's possible for someone to try to control everybody and if you just go back in history just you know go back to World War II and how Hitler control Germany and then fantastic one because it was a culture that came out of a bad time right out of World War I and this and this guy offered them pride in being German he offered this this idea of a master race at the master

race is a crazy idea because if you look at the black Israelites are you look at it or met you or you look at some of the right-wing Jewish groups every the Chinese every groups of the master of yeah sure let me know how many have tried to engineer the way Hitler did that's what's really crazy it is amazing that there is a guy who has this idea of a master race and if you were but people rejected it worldwide was one of most evil aspects of who you was that's really interesting to me the people rejected because they knew it was like an improper calculation in the calculation was the only way to get people to get the you want to go to masturbate you have to have Master genetics but it didn't take into account was compassionate didn't take into account what's necessary to have a real healthy community that was a

slow fuck a quick flash Community because everybody was like hyper focused on the nation to have a real long-term Community you have to have compassion you have to have camaraderie and there's going to be a future car in the master race when they support China and helping arrest falun gong and sell their organs that we're Google I'm stoked to me you're right you're right the left has giant flaws that's giant flaws and it's ridiculous ideas know it's against War I am too and so now you seen actual studies show this Gallup poll Democrats now support War more than Republicans

what this is about what this is about pulling out of Syria Japan and North Korea and the real problem is a real problem people not being able to say that ain't in the Trump does his good Trump got rid

of the he's getting rid of the minimum sentences I mean Hillary Clinton but I was watching through the top Democrat was they were on CNN to put the trash out I didn't do it and they and they go they go they go President Trump thinks blacks the clip was CNN CNN says Trump thinks blacks are stupid and it was a sheer panel going Trump says blacks are super Predators who have to be brought to heel and Joe that's Hillary Clinton 1994 up she passed the primack that's her quote so they're inverting reality knowing our talking point if she did that we have the video. But Hillary says blacks super Predators he didn't do that okay let's get back to what we're trying to say was that if you if he does anything good no one can accept it cuz he's on the wrong team that's part of the problem with what's going on it's part of the problem with people willing to accept ridiculous should on the left

and people bullying except ridiculous it on the right is that we get on a team and that the people that are on the left they can't admit if the economy is going well they can't admit if think they will Bill Maher said what's crash it, I don't know I lied listen I've been on a show before and I talked to him once we did a show together once with the Craig Titus he said I want abortion I said he's a comic I'm telling you man the ship that he's saying he's only saying cuz he thinks it'll work and I don't mean it but I don't know man you have to talk to him but what I'm saying is he's doing a bit he's doing what you thought was funny in that that's all it is I'll give you if you could talk to him about his legitimate opinions he's capable of having a conversation about legitimate

the red States want to be the blue States the demographic show the opposite of joke a really do I don't think even means it I mean if he doesn't mean that I disagree with them by the bucket touch up let me have a basis to emancipate singer on everything I've learned is right there just mixtures everything yes

anatomical the next Friday free black spot but the point is just that is that what we're saying was that he was doing a joke about the red States wishing that they were the blue States and you were saying that that's wrong and I was saying he's just fucking around he's like Prodigy that's it that's it

mainstream news is dead as very low ratings going down almost nothing in the whole ratings are up in the Trump era like a dead cat bounce it's like 10% of what I used to be so we're looking at that

this is the future This is Love This is Love This is where the people are real things not scripted no teleprompter there's no tell temperature this is real

and so they get up on television

remember what we were talking about Jesus Christ one problem I am literally I literally tell you what's in my brain is like my trip has been a perfect means I'm telling you I really thought

no one's watching mainstream music no one's watching mainstream is the nightly comic shows and Comedy Central shows The Daily Show Trevor Noah Stephen Colbert all those guys cuz they want some relief but it's it's not but they want relief does Sean Hannity do really well isn't it show when I'm not doing

Thomas and articulate as well all of the so-called comic shows into fake comic posing as fake news people putting up political commentary which people take is real and Believe on the street and so that's where all the propaganda is it so you say Bill Maher's just joking around Bill Maher's just over here Bill Maher just know he's doing it's all unified message they have Stephen Colbert KKK member and make jokes and you know what people shot at me on the street well that's unfortunate but what would I will say about what they're trying to do do not trying to deliver information they're not to the trying to crack jokes I guarantee you there's a whole writing staff I don't know them are shows take the Democrats I don't know if that's true but if it is a true and they do listen that's not good and that's unfortunately there's Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla

everyday from Chucky shemer lost Jimmy Fallon went from being funny to being totally weaponized so you think it was NBC's idea do you think it was someone in the government of contacts NBC in to tell Jenny very well-known UFC fighter that you know okay that shows was okay and I got a call about a month ago and they're like wow this is incredible don't say my name even talk about it later an offer this new big lucrative shell what they said you're going to come out to the Ounce Alex Jones on the show or not going to the show and he said no show hell yeah man

huh you got to denounce him on the show

well they need that from you yeah but it why would they need that from him I need him to denounce you on the shelf that gives you even more attention but that's their dilute I want to watch everybody else sensor why did Hitler sensor part of the Russian Center you like you think most of the time it works but that's a weird one man someone saying they're not going to give you a gig unless you specifically denounce Alex Jones is it

the cooking show Jo JoJo lyrics down for you okay

I swear on my kids if I was you I'd believe you I believe you but I'm saying it just seems so crazy that they would ask him to not to denounce you on the television show I'm not saying it's impossible that's what everybody who's not independent is told because there's a whole other people you're a rarity I'm are the only people that's not behold in any other network of people who else has a mega popular show that's multimedia that isn't controlled by a parent company

I'm Kerala most podcast that most podcast something you should know for a fact that you run your own show yep

that's a fact. You know she ran and all I want to say is this I want to find one point that you had about that that was really good you were saying that if you censor yourself you just like I just sent to myself a little bit just a little bit to make sure you made it in the back and it's right you we were talking and we were first of all we gave it to the big hug we talked it out we're both happy that we're not angry at each other and then we start talking you made a really good point you said the thing is if you sent herself just 1% do you say out to Center myself 1% how did they want them to make them happy and then they just going to keep moving it just going to keep moving it forward moving Gulfport move the goalposts and providing you with more money and giving you more things but keep moving in a certain direction and if you keep giving into it

they're going to have a hold of you and they can control you and that's how the network television got started if you really think about what network network television is the reason why they don't swear and they don't have explicit content isn't because people wouldn't want to see the reason is because the the advertisers won't let them there's a whole Commerce aspect to it it's not it's not just hey you're the CSI guys or hey there's a Media Matters a couple million people that call and threaten an attack anybody and then noticed show once you're done with me now it's Joe you better not have this person on or you better have that person on and so what is your soul what is your destiny worth and I always thought I was smart and so any more than I was and that's what I'm getting at is

the biggest Liars without going to know the truth I don't come up with some cold-blooded calculation about what I think should I Advance my personal life I really care about people and a process I've seen things wrong a grown-up hurt people I apologize listen that's true that's true but you're just saying about you and this is one of these little boys try to explain to people if people get mad at me for knowing you like I have a great time with that guy every time I see him you and I have had a great time in Austin we had a great time with the UFC we've hung out at numerous comedy shows that have done in Austin I've done you show me I had to go had a lot of fun together and so went when people get mad at you about Sandy Hook or about anything I just go even when he's somebody even when you are mad at me I wasn't mad at you I was like I just got to talk to him it's one of those I Eddie Bravo got the two of us to talk to him once we talk just be honest with each other will be fine

because when I was going big guns on you just so you know it's like to be a judge

I I thought the show was not an attempt to get back on your Listen to I knew that if I'd gotten to the point where your dad upset that I must have made mistakes to I'm not I'm not that person that sees things and always points in the other direction I pointed my saint my fucking ruthless self critic ruthless I'm terrible like so I beat myself up about every thousand up flood one word on stage and I'll sleep when I'm next to you

and it again self that's a good thing that she's not going to be a narcissist and crazy I got offered at the time like $5 for the Bitcoin because he was like 38 million dollars for the time I got there I refused it and I got told like eight years ago I got told by two different people are very well known British people they said I told Charles likes you want to work with you and Alexander Soros and just need to stop talking and and by the way I want you to pump Bitcoin which I believe in cryptocurrencies I believe it's the future we had a private Federal Reserve it's all Fiat I'm not judging anybody I'm just so can't be careful

and I was so dumb back then don't even say so dumb I was not in the corrupt mindset the way the world worked like I knew how politics work and I knew how science work and I knew how crypto type of government in CIA stuff worked but I was like never trying to get a deal for myself I had my own thing so that I look back in retrospect

where where that was going on so when I saw you was my Breaking Point go hey Alex Jones is full of crap George Soros was a victim of the Nazis and Holocaust just want to say I didn't see your full crap I said that he wasn't a Nazi I go the story that I watch the interview and I don't know what he did I don't know I don't know him I don't know I've know very little about him but what I remember from the story was that he was saying that when the Nazis occupied he was with his I believe it was his uncle is Godfather and took him around as a Christian and pretended he was a Christian why they were stealing from these Jews when they would take take there and he just thought it was normal because he was 13 years old but he was talking about it he was shielded by this person so I would be willing to take his explanation Swamp Thing

but but but but but here's the difference even before that happened with you I got approached by Major Hollywood actor the by Nature been associated with and they said listen George Soros told me to tell you that you have been killed if you didn't to do that and that and that and that he did what he had to do run and I said you tell George if somebody put a gun to my head and said we're going to kill you if you don't help round up Joe Rogan's kids and put them in a concentration camp I'd say oh yeah I agree with you. It was just taking property

now they were 26 it was you or not you should take your property and you don't go away I don't know I mean I don't know what happened in Romania and Hungary but Joey doesn't mean he was saying so you're saying you think that it was more no no he did it in PR interview I'm not trying to go indict George Soros okay well here's where I fucked up cuz I shouldn't even said anything about it cuz I don't know much about it think the real actual dinosaur protection I've seen I've seen a couple a child interaction so when I'm 14 and I in retrospect if somebody said we're going to run out of your community or going to kill you I would have tried to kill people that were trying to kill me I get it. Everybody's like me I might not know the type of guy I think I've proven I'll go up against people I get your 14 you're scared and you helped the Nazis she was so arrogant about it he set it on MP

are you set on 60 minutes and then I learned your being sued cuz you did this is why he's financing I'm not going to stop saying it because of that I get he was in a bad situation the problem was if you play the clip he said it was the best time of my life it was happy making it was it was invigorating to be there with all this evil going on but I was with my father and I had faith in him and shall we were able to do this and then I went to the logs and the records of Kim he was like one of her and Frank's man and getting their money and he got the money and run of a white flag shorts or us

George Soros over through all these different government trying to crash the pound George Soros is that is the archetype of James Bond villains and the fact that his money so unnerving a kid when I was like eight years old my mom always have color TV in the kitchen if she could bring those stop you can I stop you like crashing economies and when I was a kid watching PBS maybe they were lying and he's great George Soros was the international currency Speculator who overthrew government overthrow governments with what are you doing I'd literally know nothing about her

which I born in George soros's View

after World War II she got hired brought the US he work for the CIA OSS before that in his view from his perspective okay George Soros is the guy willing to take the money and divvy it out and he's a very bold guy because she's really want to hang your head in the wall

cuz I went after it but the point is it doesn't matter George Soros ran the breakup of the Soviet Union George I've had the former head of a Chevy got Jamie type and George Soros tried to crash the pound

the pound anyways I told you they got human pig you people are like it yeah I told you they're keeping babies alive you saw the Governor George Soros is highest level deep State he he is the manager or was the manager are you sure you're sick of all these things you're saying I have to know but how do you know if you've never here and the cuz I'm at the auction open years ago he ran the

Marshall we got here did George Soros break the bank of England make a little bigger please

in Britain black Wednesday September 16th is the day the speculators broke the pound it didn't actually break it but they force the British government to pull it from the European exchange rate mechanism joining the ER and was part of the first grown up please all that stood apart from the European currencies the British pound blah blah blah compounding the underlying problems inherent in the pounds inclusion the ERM I'm not seeing this where's the park with George Soros tells us jeans attract people to the pound but speculate is George Soros among them began heavily shorting the currency the British government gave in and withdrew its ER at the ERM as it became clear that it was losing billions try to Bowie its currency artificially although it was a bitter bitter pill to swallow the pound came back stronger because the excess interest in high inflation show

notice you go to m investor Expedia like it's the boss, there's films about the Soros Soros pocketed 1 billion dollars on the deal and cemented his reputation as the premier currency speculators in the world now if you're a currency speculators now what you do though I don't know what a currency speculators does it I don't want to do this works for people that run our government and he's a guy willing to do it all and he's been very successful OK my point is two plus two equals four in my in my equation you don't fight the Nazis because you're 13 14 You Think You Can't you join them and he says he'll talk to me about the investment I if I wouldn't have done it someone else would have done it that's a quote it was happy to do it if you help Round Up Jews and take your property don't say what happened that you don't talk about it show my point is him saying or you you think the way he describes it even has a problem it's problematic

disturbs you the ways describing there was happy making that it was not a big deal if I didn't do what other people to done it that's a problem what I'm telling you is that I need to get off at Soros is that if you

like 5 minutes over there on James computer he's a good job team Desiree job I'm going to say it. He's a goddamn Google wizard look at them has been beat me a quick to it's very frustrating I can pull up Soros I can pull up BBC reports Soros crashes the British pound of trying about 10 years ago was digging through stuff for basically a garage sale was a garage sale going to give it away to Charities and you all these clothes I couldn't wear cuz I do want to get hurt anymore and I can't remember got into a a group of things and it was a Japanese bayonet there was a German officers dagger them up like two hundred bucks. It's worth like $2,000 still have it wow and and and and and all the rest of it and there was a British medal in the Nazi medal and this person in my family cuz it's like a power that goes oh my God you're a Nazi so I walk in to the garage

turn on the box and I go I bought this at a gun show like a decade ago I guess I think a freaking / 200 metal thing though is if you own this is a thing if you'd like see that helmet that you were 12 German Helmet that a French artists dug up with all these Mass Graves and you're not a freaking Nazi that's a piece of History think that's a US Soldier under the last German Helmet

doesn't matter France has banned owning German war memorabilia helmet with a bullet hole at the smithsonian's not Nazi and a bunch of other War bayonet well it's a helmet in a bayonet what is the gentleman's name that makes that Shane Martin. He also made me a fucking super dope skull he's got a really big team the German helmets have a Nazi helmet 20 or look about Hogan's Heroes Hogan's Heroes is goddamn sitcom about Nazis the sitcom about Nazis and prisoners of War when that was that I literally had a family member I'm really upset about what I found

answer machine right yeah is that his name in the garage. It's like British medals u.s. medals a couple of course I wanted the Japanese thing

it's not as cool as world war against the machine on Instagram special stage he made me another sculpture to that I bought from a metal skull I'm not saying you're a Nazi. Defense family think because I had one Nazi party member metal yeah it'll be losing it is from a battlefield dead people puke it couldn't be any more interesting Darkness and Light comes out of it you make evil become good love you talk to the artist thought of doing this guy's stuff look at that eagle go back to that a bird with a fucking cylinders with the car so is that what it is first or the band

the table shows on a car cylinder that's a car cylinder yeah that's a Polish Town Car cylinder and then bayonets for the artist bad he's a great artist brought this up because I walked in there and I said God is dope that is amazing and and you took you told the story like they dig up that these battlefields in France stop people get this stuff that's a rotting German Helmet then you put light in and it makes it beautiful and it takes the evil of Hitler and makes you beautiful yeah. Hitler humanity and makes it beautiful yeah it's but but it is interesting that you can't own like you could never owned a Nazi flag or any like you could both my grandfathers. Brian about family but you never Tom Landry my grandfather was UT football won state championships and track all of my mom's dad

Jesus Christ

we're having a great time talking about interdimensional beings and I don't know bro listen to high school research of each other out that's a good thing if he can't do it you know you think I'm afraid of this was no I definitely don't think you're afraid of this which is why I don't want to do it just tell me

you know what to tell you story together come sit down please grab each other and you fall down hit your head back when I was a blue belt 1995 I worked in strip club in and there was this girl I was dating she was never a t she was a bartender she was seriously 4 foot 10 and she weigh bartenders and waitresses always I don't know who she was and she was 92 lb

Bartender the smallest girl and I showed her how to do a rear naked her shoes name is Kimmy and the strip club manager was your side like you used to be bought but yeah but used to be Punk until used to be football player type manager strip clubs looking big dude and he had a Corvette and he didn't believe when you get so tall and she said he said she could choke me out with one of them Jiu-Jitsu moves I'll give her the keys to my Corvette

so she had to deliver the guy on a bar stool and she was standing on a bar so I had to go around them and she would like that and then he win it's out he dropped like a sack of potatoes to be hit his head on the fucking floor impact the impact of his head hitting the floor and then he pops back up

they need to know what the fuk happened it's just sitting here going to tell you what

I thought that's what I'm getting at that people usually don't get the ground pop back up usually they hit the ground they're done and they need an ambulance right but he pop right back up like bitch you need to give her your Corvette

what are you doing let's go to school will you fucking give you don't even know you can just saw Bill Hicks life I've known Alex since there's a bunch of old pictures and I lifted weights people don't do to be bigger be to work at 3 hours I was addicted and then I got on radio on TV and lights for the drinking and just stop it didn't work out for like 10 years be like a hundred pounds

let's get you on something will we actually like put it online and did talk about what you're doing if you commit to something online like that you'll do it all you have to do is like set a realistic goal at 40 pull up like 2:40 in a row like CrossFit type of oil for use your whole body and everything or yes amazing amazing but the problem was I used to go to all you can eat buffets that's amazing to Chinese and I don't believe in order I don't know I don't want the to do you think about this what do you think about a self-improvement thing that you do online will you do it online I need to do the promise every time I try to work out the phone's ringing inside horseshit let's listen you just get up earlier get up an hour and a half earlier once you get your bicep torn you're probably going to be a little bit of action but that's only six months so you know what Nowitzki had it done it's fucking amazing that my bicep done to the shoulder to the bicep

go back to the album bicep to the shoulder different don't know you have to do it

no no no no no no no no no no no no there's no need to choke you out to check him out here if you hate that shit James on point is always Curious George Soros past that we just talked about

you were talking about the strip club the guy truck in the garage the girl truck in the guy out of the guy falling hitting his head and it won't happen after that any ideas Jamie know whenever it's stupid for that one of us got choked out I never watch all the babies I don't know what it was it was cool I don't think I've ever been so completely out maybe for a second. Check and I was like 13 tied up and she live down the street don't know if she goes like 12 and she goes I'll have sex with you is a true story I'll have sex with you if you like to put makeup on you so I'm going to guess everything I have sex with her and she's super hot and she goes

Facebook relationship went really well until like 30 year old boyfriend caught me at our place once cuz your mom is working O Mine trying to kill me in the parking lot so I can put makeup on you are some of the things I have

not conspiracies but real world program developing a breakaway civilization what is a breakaway civilization you understand that it's the key to everything standardized total surveillance control grit the power supplies power control human-animal hybrids that match farming of humanoid tissue transshipment and games we covered the multi-layered binary weapon Delivery Systems that's what we have in that what's that well the thing is 5G behavioral modifications we hit that Trojan Horse delivery system cell phones vaccines GMOs have been tested designed to hurt you again vaccines are real you can give somebody something to give them the cured but they're jacking it like a cell phone with vaccines okay tell me what you've always use this cuz everyone's heard of it everyone heard about 1947 to 1983

it only came public because the program is exposed in Peru and promote disposal West Virginia put the media picked up his with white on black not all the white people have to uncover black or white injecting over a million people with live syphilis in the name of vaccines you know about Tuskegee they do know about that but if you only know about Alabama and over 40 something years only injecting blacks

but it happened all the world search engine Hillary Clinton apologizes for syphilis experiments in Tuskegee what was the Tuskegee was the the conventional story that they had syphilis but they weren't really cheering them that's a cover but is that what they say okay I understand what you're saying but was the the the conventional explanation of what happened was that they knew that they had it and they allowed them know that we have you heard about the u.s. apologizes for Guatemala STD experiments that a little do goats grow up so I can read it US Government medical researchers intentionally infected hundreds of people in Guatemala including institutionalized mental patients with gonorrhea

and syphilis without their knowledge or permission more than sixty years ago Jesus Christ show again when you've read is what I do is Jesus Christ so many of those infected were encouraged to pass the infection that you just as part of the study where does it say what is it strange to have syphilis but you've never had sex before 1948

God damn that. 4648

then imagine show

here's what's happened we had a real liberal media in this country they weren't left us that's that's when I said don't look up information after I proved all the forest was and she had one in 1999 and prove it they all said Alex Jones is right it's incredible that's the WTO tape that I always cite that type that we show the agent provocateurs went into a peaceful protest and start smashing windows and show imagine used to the the Press would get a lot of stuff right but they would get demoted or whatever happened once Trump got in which I don't think Trump's bad and I got little things good but I almost think like it's more sophisticated they put him in on it piss everybody off to get the liberals who traditionally been the real watch dogs for free speech and its human experimentation and suddenly they're like in Gallup polls

wheel of experimentation we love everything I get chills right now and so imagine Joe I've been on here for 23 years and I'm a newshound I spend for 5 hours every 2 minutes, probably have NBC news that our government gay people notice I said Peru because that was a big document to can't you just found Guatemala I still going on so imagine imagine I have literally by the time Sandy Hook happens I've literally seen 10,000 articles and documents are more where they're admitting in 1962 The Joint Chiefs of Staff under llm answer came to President Kennedy this on PBS and said we're going to blow up buildings shoot up schools and movie theaters and bombed army bases in Marine bases we're going to have people with their kids with name change their CIA get on a jumbo jet that takes off it gets blown up over the Caribbean

blame Cuba but that plane really lands and there's another plane that's a drone we blow up and then Kennedy says no but his brother says no I'll do it while they killed Kennedy Bobby said he would but then he got pissed when they killed his brother so the class and he wanted to bomb the Honduran Embassy and blow up stuff and go to war with Moscow Bobby was bad. Pull up Bobby Kennedy wanted to bomb the US Embassy in Honduras this is Declassified and so imagine you see hundreds of these and then a Sandy Hook happen in your lister's don't buy it and then it's a psychosis where then

well because every every man I knew about this hypothetical about that was great every man I knew when I was a kid backhanded me and beat the crap out of me so men are bad for a woman has been raped the other states like The psychosis and I'm not going to put myself down like I'm a victim I'm being honest represent actively that I got to wear when I learned that so much stuff was false then later I experienced where I had to guess I did the thing I knew it was true and then people made up a whole story because they don't believe anything anymore show and that's all I'm trying to say do you need a part of it is that the even though the stuff does exist it's almost like there's too many things happening for one person to pay attention to all of them and if you're only focusing on it can be incredibly overwhelming cuz you start thinking that's the whole world that the whole world sees conspiracies cuz he's the things you're concentrating on primarily but this this what I'm saying

operation Northwoods now that is some that's about as you look at operations North would you look at that shit that is about as gangster in Sinister evil as you went over just a little while ago we were going to Italy before you got here is if you believe that no other conspiracy theory weather or the right or wrong the government conspiracy should be ridiculed you shouldn't there's no that should be all right like you you're right you should instead of looking at him with ridicule you should look in a move jective Lee exactly and the only the only people that have a right to ridicule conspiracy theories are people that don't believe in any conspiracy theories any of them yes I understand why you're really killing it

the other ones you don't believe them I think you should be more I don't believe in that shit but I understand why people do almost almost almost in Ford trial in Texas and and and Connecticut cuz I want to the lawyers already agreed it I'm going to sit there and I'm going to show them history and all these things to say

Which ones I want to talk about Apollo 100 followers are they were practicing address to get to this next and I respect you and I want you guys to yell at each other for 3 minutes while I go pee I gotta pee yourself just hold will do I go first okay anyways you know what I'm saying this in your bad questioning I get it no you do get it but you know why because you know of course

of course Alex you you are someone that I could talk to about the Flat Earth conspiracy and you believed in so many crazy things about the government you don't you don't you don't believe in Flat Earth but you can kind of understand where I'm coming from right GPS is real airline pilots that fly from California to new places like Australia and they got another Wing over to Hong Kong and then they go to Moscow and you can fly anywhere in the world if it was you could go from east to west just like you could on a ball you just don't understand what I like a the pizza as you can just go anywhere like if you're on a flat earther give me two cities book point of two cities in cash we got so much I get when you question

what time he's just fucking around by nobody cares

that's what I'm saying I'm being honest lyrics I'm not like certifiably crazy but I deal with this all day long I get like Joe trash out why people go crazy don't know why I never saw that clip of that guy saying that they would resuscitate the babies and then they would make a decision about that New York a bill that they're trying to pass I mean it's a goddamn fucking organ harvesting doctors control outside of love you heard that piece of shit fucking

it's incredible KKK blackface they elected if they had that shit and when he messed up and said we should be allowed to get their fucking organs they use that to be activated

she said fraternities have you screw sheep and all this and you'll give God blowjob that's why I joined them because they want to come over

fraternities I'm so happy as I do this podcast I'm so happy I got you I got some nice how many JRE Clips they're going to make it as yet do they going to make it to put YouTube music we should put you to so yeah we did we did listen I'm with you this many just kind of freaked me out about several subjects no no no bulshit that article says that there was no written data on that it's that came from three interviews they had so

course they tried it why would they try it if you were if you were the leader of the Free World like didn't wasn't there some goddamn it was it the Nazis that were they were trying to theorize how to combine humans with animals to make a stronger human pressure right like in for sure they they they they definitely I mean I think all governments definitely give their soldiers steroids they definitely give them in feta means they get from definitely give them chemicals to make them crazy should I would are you kidding that's why they started doing this fucking Army rather than the kamikazes read that a hundred percent. On YouTube

yeah that that was one of the ways they would get them not just like nationalism Pride for the country they would do with Jack them up on crystal meth and that's why they fly that plane right after that fucking boat that is a Nutty thing to do man you got to be you got to be in a weird state of mind and you got to have such a horrible life that I fuck it let me just crash into this fucking boat right for the Jaguar like happy about that I can't wait to escape this shit insane Choice it's the only PC has is when he's in that plane killing people but I fucking crazy choice that you going to do that for you Alex welcome back we're talkin about kamikazes kamikazes wear that was did they gave him crystal meth right was not a part of the program warfare's always drugs and I've ever seen.

Japanese like their foot in World War One to just go ahead and give him a message but she tells your brain everything is super toxic and so yeah monosodium glutamate like the stuff from Chinese food is that we would give them

all the Germans were big on steroids and methamphetamine just saying that oh the secrets what are the positions not to be yes this is the real thing okay you know them who's telling you this stuff. Classify today Beyond class 530 no I mean in Dallas

any work for a the inventor of indoor air conditioning was a billionaire in the what's the rich area Dallas were the Republicans all live now it's not our lieutenants it's the thing right there in the middle of Dallas on it like he lived up there and it was just from him

you know I guess I'm not going to get into it. The point is is that Hitler was on the cover of Time Magazine and and he wants true unless that's a Photoshop that I saw the cover of Time Magazine too but not really wasn't just my grandfather was his other people my grandfather said it was really confusing for him because he he work for this guy that was in refrigeration air conditioning when he was in high school and his dad owned the car dealerships Dallas stuff they live there for Jerry Dallas and when did they tell you well through one reason he wanted in the butt by the temperature started to drop out of UT and you know all that and go join the Army Air corps teaches you tell me all this time I'm going to your grandfather is a little eccentric now like my relative burner von Braun

your grandpa knew Warner Von Braun born Hutchinson was eventually but if I get it now

and so the hot yeah that's what that is Uber mention so they only would talk people that were in the club and show you high IQ the whole nine yards show he was working with this German guy and it was just go over there after school or claim is apprentice and my grandfather watch them get more more depressed and warmer Crazy by the end of the thirties and the guy who buys it and he said he said to climb with her grandmother Sammy said yeah the Nazis have my family in Germany they're going to kill them all about I'm having to give me everything I got all my money and I'm having to sell the patents and work like that for like 20 hours a day giving everything he had because of Achilles family in Nazi Germany he was German and so my grandfather wouldn't listen them here because she had that experience he was so mad I was a kid was like when I was a kid in Dallas wbap had Hitler speeches on cuz Germans are big part of the us and it was the bun if I was supposed to join it and

Hitler was good and we never really bought into it and then I found out this a mentor of mine so that's what the Nazis would would do was extort and control so I kind of heard about that like a week during the summer and I was like eight-years-old orbital spacecraft with Landon Scrabble Texaco and he was a military base all these goddamn Nazis and you know one time I didn't want to do it but that guy smarted off about how big that bore better shooting airplanes down so I went ahead and just ran his head right to the wall and I never knew what happened after that so you just got to kill Nazis and his son of a bitch

10000 of those assholes and I'm like listen to this I'm like I'm going to read about Nazis but how about can I start buying books on my cop like reading Hitler's my struggle no I'm not an option Michael both my grandfathers told me how bad Nazis were both almost died fighting Nazis so I wanted to know about Nazis it was this whole ethos and so that's just the whole story of understanding that and that my dad's angle my grandfather's angle also their Operation Paperclip you can call it paperclip he was several waves there was $34,000 in there was a lot of Nazi scientists brought over on YouTube it says the Operation Paperclip was anywhere from like 1200 to 1500 PSI nitrogen the total number of admitted Congressional hearings

1970s long as I see the numbers 34200 something but it up is a fascinating they brought those people over here and that's where the the Space Program came from just came from not to or they already have the CIA

the cia's OSS record okay I don't know what that means that was before the CIA let me see I came out he was in auxiliary the Navy combat the office of

Chrissy the OSS was British intelligence are the most powerful British dog most powerful dog stays here they set up Brighthouse in 22 after World War II to anglicize see you at the British talent is not a British intelligence take over our marriage dissolved meant to be dumb down mean to turn you off will you go to the real academic stuff we don't lose our Frontline stuff was true later have a document so it's all real that bought the Embassy in Honduras Nazis Nazis six Moon missions was a Nazi and he was broadcast over over smoke weed and 1/2 guys did and why

Define Wernher von Braun that's fine that they hadn't developed as soon as you see Red Skull Marvel comic they got a big bomb in Love New York wasn't a bomber it was a space point and it was about half the size it looks just like this

and the Germans actually some of their size with the Russians who were the Russians tried to build their space shuttles have a size that was actually German plant

show you look it up because the Russians took a lot of Germans as well

reason I'm wearing this is explained this is a gate with all of it so you have British intelligence that it won World War II Germany had way more advanced technology

they then take over British intelligence basically merges with the US and then the Germans and other say we've got to go way ahead and Technology was all theoretical and lab but they couldn't match the point they didn't have enough machine shops and systems to build it and US Special Forces went on a suicide mission to blow up the underground Mountain how about the Nazis were the first to build flying saucers that's crazy British mason jars British intelligence flying saucers

so now the Nazis are over here they don't listen you don't want them running everything and they go to Eisenhower and they say we want to launch a off-base breakaway civilization you compartmentalize things forget Empires can you have a new ruling class technological a leech and then the elites are all in charge the Public's watching TV and we'll give him widgets and Foundation series type things to the barbasol the documents

and let them have an Empire will build a whole new Empire and so Eisenhower gives a speech worried about is it just an alternative, she says the technological Elite watch the full 40 women of speech is farewell address in 62 he says 61 he says you need to watch out about the scientist because because he said no to the NASA plan when he found out what it was it's a breakaway civilization where you don't try to run the whole planet you siphon off resources and build a whole new Advanced system and then you play body up against each other and collapse it what is NASA and we can take NASA back over it's bigger than the CIA it's the real government the spaceship should have stuff that's all PR NASA is the real government

bassador to Breakaway governments to Shadow government

and so you had one that was British run

and the Germans came to our own u.s. Allegiance said hey you always need a couple plants they said we've got all this on the drawing board to eat you a plan to poison the food and water to get rid of dumb people applying for off-world bases we've got by the way we're taking hardcore drugs or in contact with aliens how is it going to snow tonight was the Germans first got in touch with how they do it never really want to call French really into the temperature in Sebastian around him at all times on Jeep PhD level history books okay is the German Breakaway government just always the Germans the Brits fighting for dominance so what you're saying is when Operation Paperclip acquired all those Nazi scientist they essentially start running now so so NASA became like almost like an offshoot of the German government this offshoot government yeah the Germans had pal all the wealth away

they had everything so they make them really make sense though that in 2019 that's still going on at the British the British Empire was just bankrupt itself World War 1 it said will give you the Keys of the Kingdom Churchill wrote three books the history of the English-speaking peoples he was half American and this is officially in books we merge with a British Empire in like 1930 covertly okay that's what is British intelligence intelligence

okay so you got you got a butt German intelligence chain to Eisenhower and said listen you don't need to do all that she's we haven't given them a real technology

we're in contact with aliens and then tell us the whole planet where are you getting this from you stating so confidently

it's in the literature man Hitler like would go in literature Main Line historical books about sharks and give the technology so they are you surprised

know if demons are real definitely think they've been inside the Nazis but what I'm telling you is no media is going to attack us I'm giving you want to know where I can read it read that those statements that they were in contact with the aliens Grill Society VR IL Society get a check since I choose the right up there with them like doing rituals cool yeah I'd like to listen I think that they are absolutely obsessed with the occult that's been pretty well-documented next form of nuclear fuel heavy water and we had to send in Special Forces on suicide missions that was really special forces to blow it up and I'm telling you the Germans had all

fortunate that shit they just couldn't ever keep the plants from getting blown up because they were a few years behind

Churchill wrote about this in his Memoirs and said the Germans were way ahead it wasn't that the Germans were bad that is not too bad but it wasn't that they wasn't the Germans that first bomb Cecilia Targets in 1941 the Brits were losing the war Hitler was bombing there for their medical facilities military facilities and so they went and bombed German towns and German cities like I was the famous German City Dresden what was the designated safe for kids people died one night to trick Hitler to turn his bombers on the general population that I tricked him psychologically to do it but but but but Churchill

this is been Declassified HHH and esoteric books it submitted so Hitler was set up what Hitler was bad because what happened Albert Speer was she is Chief armaments and Architects measured at British travel agent Rudolf Hess was the deputy fuhrer they got Hitler totally love you never hear about him since 1941 cuz they had a peace treaty with Edward the 8th who was the king of anyone who was a Nazi and it was German first family and they had a deal to Stage the attack the French stood down Vici French didn't fight they put they put Nazi occupiers in that the Dunkirk operation was allowed to evacuate Edwards the eighth was supposed to then sue for peace through Neville Chamberlain

but it's come out that he was all set up by Churchill and others how they ran Hitler. They weren't bad they're pretty good but date Master manipulated him and never Chamberlain all of them and battle the British people in America to come in that deals with a with Roosevelt to didn't bring us into the war and that was the whole master plan you guys should go to the history and see all that that's what's so incredible Joe when you when you at when you have all this info and so Rudolf Hess

and I see 4142 he flies a one-man bomber he was a World War 1 fighter Ace by the number 302

the castle the King was in at the time and likes Northern England for the name of it Kiki parachutes in with the peace treaty signed by the king of England they lock him up in the tower for the rest of his life

a London

andeavor the eight had to Advocate type in Edward the 8th Hitler and you'll see him in videos or films and photos he was in Spain World War II start it where do you think the contact with the aliens came from when did that start the most important thing we're not aliens like that I get that motherfuking vodka loose steak I need to hear about the aliens are you know what's crazy about aliens is it YouTube made a big announcement that they're going to go after a 911 videos anything I don't know this is true I don't know but is it true that there demonetizing any videos that have truth or Liberty in them

it's crazy how they're going after 9/11 miracle cures know how to get a blowing up alien videos is wonderful and she's sweet montage videos out there that's best ways that the top top of the line sponsors that's like the number one hits me like one of them everyone drives on YouTube it's like 8 I'm saying I'm a lien videos get monetized did not offencive people get drawn into a government cover-up

how did the connection with alien start you said this is the most important thing to discuss in the podcast I love you to death you're awesome that's why I asked you to be here if you want to do it. I still love you I don't care

I don't care about that. This is not what I believe I love you for who you are I'm trying to tell you something listen

imitation okay I'm not making this stuff up I believe you believe it no man the stuff I told you earlier about my dad to the table being offered a half million dollars in 1987 wasn't here for that part he came in later but tell me how the connection with aliens got started

with who connection aliens do nachos on when people started becoming obsessed with contact with the aliens who sang the 1947 you know they Flood YouTube and make sure media like I always thought it was safe and out of the private seller deserve that he will do whatever I want some big show as long as they make the aliens in with it and you know what that's right I remember when I was balls deep in Aliens I believed all that should I believe it used to be that you'd be a conspiracy theorist if you believe in aliens how many more you believe in aliens do this is real friends. Let's tell me how the connection between aliens and the Nazis took place when did all the start running again

this is really killing each other so surreal Neal I believe you this is you ask me where they it's people who are psychically genetically available to interface in the shack readily diverse Universe with all these Dimensions above and below in all around us with consciousnesses and the truth is no energy that were destroyed all continues on the truth is our bodies is a fact or a communal Hive organism of all of our ancestors and all of their race memories but not in just some compressed epigenetic system it's beyond that it's an electrochemical antenna they proved in this that connects the higher and lower Dimensions show our bodysuit Zara cuz our our our our predecessors what what is the position without giving us a body Chute to this damn our families are loving us they're holding us they're wrapped all around us their strength or will there bad they're good their sins the good things they did the battles they won the bet

I lost the woman I love. The man they love it's all in us all these people taller able to look into so many things and have so many different experiences and show all the shaman all the ancient religions everybody says there are the good ones that are the bad ones and then people are interfacing so you say where does it begin from the Tibetans to the mesoamericans the Egyptians to The Druids to every ancient Society described the same thing there are bad things look like elves that have horns when they show you who they really are and there are good things but they don't contact you unless you contact him and then they are almost not even concerned with what you're doing I never bought into this one's going to think about what I hear when I was a kid what did I see what was coming out there in the documents what was being admitted when I read all these books about World War II in the Nazis and Hitler obsessed with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan sand what they were able to do without drugs interface with this and all the rituals they would do and how they were believed that be on the Aether like a skull and bones is a German Death cult
